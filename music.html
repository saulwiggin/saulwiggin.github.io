    			    <p class="lead"> I have always enjoyed music. I played the saxophone since I was 14 years old. I founded my school's first 
					jazz/funk band.
					This was part of a jazz funk combo I performed in with two other class mates Lawerence Panter on Keys and Henry Pollock on 
					Bass Guitar. We
					Would practice at the house of Specials bassist Sir Horace gentleman. I also performed with a ska band rude boys don't cry.
					We recorded a record and 
					performed ska gigs across rugby and Coventry. The gigs with both jazz and ska bands were paid. I also performed with Warwick 
					Universities own Big Band.
					We performed at a jazz club on tour in Brighton.</p>
