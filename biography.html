I am completing a PhD at Queen Mary university, school of electronic engineering, antennas and electromagnetics group on FDTD simulations of RF Metamaterials. My supervisor was Professor Yang Hao, Professor Clive Parini FRS and Professor Ian Youngs (DSTL). I was funded partly by the EPRSC and partly by DSTL. I have designed applications for transformation optics to engineering electromagnetic waves and optics. I worked with the QUEST platform grant. Previous to this I completed my Masters at the University of Manchester on Physics where my final year project involved astrophysical simulations of Masers around Late type stars.

<h1>Saul Joseph Wiggin – C.V.
Summary </h1>

<p>I have a doctorate from Queen Mary College, University of London from the school of electronic engineering and computer science. I have a undergraduate degree in Physics from The University of Manchester. I have worked as an intern doing CPU design in assembly. I have completed an internship as a web developer using VB.net, Visual Studio, MYSQL and XML for an internet of things GUI with backend, database and a web frontend. I have learnt programming languages C++, Python programming tasks in my sparetime. </p>

<h2>Education </h2>

<h3>09/2010 - 08/2014, Queen Mary University, University of London, PhD Transformation Optics and Metamaterials</h3>
<p><ul>
<li>My area of Research was transformation optics and metamaterials involved in invisibility. </li>
<li>I was a finalist of the 2013 discovering startups competition hosted by Cambridge Wireless for a business based on my patent.</li>
<li>Obtained a patent on one of my device designs for BAE systems for a Rectangular Luneburg Lens.
Sponsorship of 3.5 year PhD by the Defence Science and Technology Laboratories (DSTL) and partly with a grant from the Engineering and Physical Sciences Council (EPRSC) and platform grant on the Quest for the Ultimate in Electromagnetic Spatial Transformation (QUEST) which was a £5m grant.  
</li>
<li>I presented my work at international conferences at META14 in Paris and EUCAP in Orlando Florida.</li> 
<li>I wrote a small popular science book called Beyond Materials: Metamaterials and Transformation Optics.</li>
<li>Computer Programming was written in MATLAB and C. </li>
<li>Antenna simulation software HFSS, FEKO, CST. 
Lab work taken place in antenna measurements facility.</li>

</ul>
</p>

<h3>09/2005 - 10/2009, The University of Manchester Msc, Physics</h3>

<p> <ul> <li>
I specialised in particle physics. </li>
<li>I got experience with a LINUX operating system and programming in FORTRAN where I completed a simulation research project on laser pumping due to stellar hydrodynamics with data visualisation in IDL hosted on a supercomputer.</li>
<li>I took the core physics modules which included electromagnetism, nuclear physics, solid state physics, astronomy, mathematics and C# programming and  took electives in philosophy. See academic transcript for marking breakdown. I specialised in physics given me excellent analytical and problem solving skills. </li>
<li>Laboratory work took place 2 days a week for 3 years and lab reports were created for each laboratory session of which there was one every semester each time working in a different team using different equipment.</li>
<li>Independent research conducted in the library and online with books and scientific journals. </li></ul></p>
