	<p> This blog on wordpress contains the up-to-date commentary of my research. I mostly work in matlab so any codes require matlab. I am investigating using transformation optics and metamaterials
	in optical systems. I may also run some experiments on something interesting I've read. <p>

<p>
I am completing a PhD at Queen Mary university, school of electronic engineering, antennas and electromagnetics group on FDTD simulations of RF Metamaterials. My supervisor was Professor Yang Hao, Professor Clive Parini FRS and Professor Ian Youngs (DSTL). I was funded partly by the EPRSC and partly by DSTL. I have designed applications for transformation optics to engineering electromagnetic waves and optics. I worked with the QUEST platform grant. Previous to this I completed my Masters at the University of Manchester on Physics where my final year project involved astrophysical simulations of Masers around Late type stars.

<h1>Saul Joseph Wiggin – C.V.
Summary </h1>

<p>I have a doctorate from Queen Mary College, University of London from the school of electronic engineering and computer science. I have a undergraduate degree in Physics from The University of Manchester. I have worked as an intern doing CPU design in assembly. I have completed an internship as a web developer using VB.net, Visual Studio, MYSQL and XML for an internet of things GUI with backend, database and a web frontend. I have learnt programming languages C++, Python programming tasks in my sparetime. </p>
