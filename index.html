			<p> The current version of my software product which is called Icarus is being developed now. This software has a modern frontend framework which works on the web. Attractive to look at using twitter bootstrap. It uses the latest JavaScript technologies AngularJS for interactivity. The service offered is one for analysing large data sets. If you have big data we offer an attractive user interface for searching, tabulating and storing large datasets. The test case is on genomics data, the works of William Shakespeare and astrophysics data. </p>
<p>
The software runs on a raspberry pi so it is cheap, much cheaper than buyer a new pc. This means that multiple individual workstations can be purchased. We use cutting eadge natural text processing techniques running on the linux kernal on the raspberry pi to deliver low cost, high performance computing tailor made to scientific requirements.

		<p class="lead">Metamaterials were described as one of the top 10 scientific breakthroughs of the last decade by Science magazine. Metamaterials are a new paradigm in science. A modern day scientific revolution where a slight change in perception, as Einsteins slight reformulation of the laws of relativity has led to a whole new field in Physics.</p>
		 <p> The technology has immediate applications to optics and antenna technology. Kymeta use metamaterials for flat space communication dishes. Kymeta has so far received 2 rounds of £50m funding from Bill Gates and was for two years running voted in the top 50 disruptive technologies by techcrunch disrupt. I wrote a book on it called <a href="http://www.lulu.com/shop/saul-wiggin/beyond-matter-invisibility-and-subwavelength-imaging/paperback/product-21833169.html">Beyond Materials </a></p>
		  <p> I am a published reviewer for Packt publishing on a book called <a href="https://www.packtpub.com/web-development/knockoutjs-web-development">KnockoutJS for Web Development</a> which requires subscription to access. KnockoutJS allows two way data binding using observables on the front end. </p>
		  <p>I am currently writing the first draft of a book to be published by them called Haskell Parallel Programming. This includes chapters on parallel programming in Haskell using the eval monad, the par monad, big data in Haskell, HAXL. The first draft is currently being reviewed.</p>

    			    <p class="lead"> I have always enjoyed music. I played the saxophone since I was 14 years old. I founded my school's first jazz/funk band.
					This was part of a jazz funk combo I performed in with two other class mates Lawerence Panter on Keys and Henry Pollock on Bass Guitar. We
					Would practice at the house of Specials bassist Sir Horace gentleman. I also performed with a ska band rude boys don't cry. We recorded a record and 
					performed ska gigs across rugby and Coventry. The gigs with both jazz and ska bands were paid. I also performed with Warwick Universities own Big Band.
					We performed at a jazz club on tour in Brighton.</p>
