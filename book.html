		<p class="lead">Metamaterials were described as one of the top 10 scientific breakthroughs of the last decade by Science magazine. 
		Metamaterials are a new paradigm in science. A modern day scientific revolution where a slight change in perception, as Einsteins 
		slight reformulation of the laws of relativity has led to a whole new field in Physics.	The technology has immediate applications 
		to optics and antenna technology. Kymeta use metamaterials for flat space communication dishes. Kymeta has so far received 2 rounds
		of £50m funding from Bill Gates and was for two years running voted in the top 50 disruptive technologies by techcrunch disrupt. 
		I wrote a book on it called <a href="http://www.lulu.com/shop/saul-wiggin/beyond-matter-invisibility-and-subwavelength-imaging/paperback/product-21833169.html">Beyond Materials </a>.
		   I am a published reviewer for Packt publishing on a book called  <a href="https://www.packtpub.com/web-development/knockoutjs-web-development">KnockoutJS for Web Development</a> which requires 
		  subscription to access. KnockoutJS allows two way data binding using observables on the front end. 
		  I am currently writing the first draft of a book to be published by them called Haskell Parallel Programming. This includes 
		  chapters on parallel programming in Haskell using the Eval monad, the Par monad, big data in Haskell, HAXL. The first draft is 
		  currently being reviewed.</p>
