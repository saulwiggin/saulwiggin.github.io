		  <p class="lead"> My PhD was on Designing Optical Systems using Transformation Optics and Metamaterials. I have written papers on using transformation optics to 
		  design optical systems using transformation optics. My research took place at Queen Mary University of London in the Antennas and electromagnetics group. The
		  research involved minimising the Seidel aberrations in an optical lens using metamaterials and transformation optics. Simulations were done using Finite
		  Difference Time Domain method written in Matlab and C and run in parallel on electromagnetic computing clusters. I presented my research at APS 2013 in Orlando Florida and META 2012 in Paris France.
		  I was sponsored by DSTL. I was the finalist of the competition discovering startup's 2013 held by Cambridge wireless. This
			was based on a design for a conformal, all dielectric Luneberg lens design I did which was patented by BAE systems. 
			This device allows broadband propagation of electromagnetic waves from satellite communications. This is a novel design 
			for a device similar to the technology used by American based startup Kymeta shown below.
